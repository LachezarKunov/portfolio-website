      "Developed a C++ multiset that efficiently stores large sets of numbers using just 1 bit per element, leading to substantial memory savings, especially for large datasets. It uses bit operations, making it effective for applications with limited memory resources. This project was a homework assignment for  the OOP C++ course at university and received a perfect score!",

    description:
      "Developed a custom C++ string class with a focus on efficient memory management and high performance. The string dynamically allocates memory, resizing the buffer only when necessary to optimize performance. To reduce reallocation overhead, the capacity doubles when the string exceeds its current size. The class includes operations like concatenation, comparison, and different operators.",
