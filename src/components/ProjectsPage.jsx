            multiset that efficiently stores large sets of numbers using just 1 bit
            per element, leading to substantial memory savings, especially for large
            datasets. It uses bit operations, making it effective for applications
            with limited memory resources. This project was a homework assignment for 
            the OOP C++ course at university and received a perfect score!'

            memory management and high performance. 
            The string dynamically allocates memory, resizing the buffer only when necessary to optimize performance. 
            To reduce reallocation overhead, the capacity doubles when the string exceeds its current size. 
            The class includes operations like concatenation, comparison, and different operators.'
